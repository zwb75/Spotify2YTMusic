## Introduction

**Spotify2YTMusic** is a powerful Python tool that seamlessly transfers your music library from Spotify to YouTube Music. It features both a modern graphical interface and a command-line interface, making it easy to copy playlists, liked songs, and followed artists between platforms.

---

## ‚ú® What's New

### **Batch Size Control (NEW)**
- **Adjustable Batch Size:** You can now set how many tracks are processed together (1‚Äì20) using a slider in the main interface.
- **Quick Presets:** Instantly set Safe, Balanced, Fast, or Max batch sizes with one click.
- **Live Guidance:** Color-coded descriptions help you pick the best setting for your connection and reliability needs.

### **Smart Resume System**
- **Automatic Header Expiration Detection:** Detects when YouTube Music headers expire and pauses gracefully.
- **Progress Saving:** Automatically saves progress after each batch, not just on errors.
- **Seamless Resume:** After updating expired headers, transfers resume exactly where they left off at the batch level.

### **Real-time Progress Tracking**
- **Batch-level Progress:** Shows detailed progress for each batch being processed and verified.
- **Live Status Updates:** Real-time feedback on search, add, and verification operations.
- **Success Rate Reporting:** Shows exact transfer success rates and detailed logs of any failed tracks.

### **Improved Verification**
- **Whole Playlist Verification:** After any interruption, the app verifies all tracks that should be in the playlist, not just those added after resuming, for accurate success reporting.

### **API Management**
- **Dedicated Quota Testing:** New "Test API Quota" functionality to check quotas without running transfers.
- **Intelligent Quota Detection:** Correctly distinguishes between real quota exhaustion and YouTube Music backend delays.
- **Header Validation:** Real-time validation of YouTube Music headers before saving.

### **Improved Transfer Process**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Header Expiration (New Handling)**
- Headers typically expire every 20-30 minutes
- The app now automatically detects expiration and pauses gracefully
- Progress is saved at the batch level, so you resume exactly where you left off
- Simply update headers in Settings and the transfer continues automatically

**Transfer Interruptions (Enhanced)**
- Resume functionality works at the batch level for maximum efficiency
- Check the `progress_*.json` files to see saved state

**Missing Tracks (Improved Display)**
- Missing tracks are now clearly displayed in the UI output log
- Each playlist shows exactly which tracks couldn't be found
- Some tracks may not be available on YouTube Music due to licensing
- Alternative versions might be found instead

**Backend Delays (No More False Warnings)**
- YouTube Music sometimes delays updating playlist track counts
- The app now correctly identifies this as a backend delay, not quota exhaustion
- Wait a few minutes (sometimes it may take a while) and check your playlist - the tracks should appear
- No longer shows misleading "quota exhaustion" messages for this issue

**Authentication Problems**
- **Spotify:** Verify Client ID, Secret, and Redirect URI in Settings
- **YouTube Music:** Re-extract headers if they expire or validation fails
- **Settings now validate headers in real-time before saving**
- Delete the `.cache` file if you get Spotify authentication errors

### New Features for Debugging

1. **Enhanced Logging:** More detailed output shows exactly what's happening at each step
2. **Progress Files:** Check `progress_*.json` files to see exactly where transfers stopped
3. **Header Validation:** Settings dialog now validates headers before saving
